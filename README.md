# Smart-Contracts-with-Solidity
This projects aims to create an Ethereum-based Smart Contract which accepts Ether and divides it evenly among a hypothetical group of employees. This would allow a Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

Contract coding and set-up:
To begin with, you will need to make sure that both Ganache and MetaMask are up and running in your machina. Make sure that MataMask is connected to your local network.
Secondly, Remix needs to be opened for development of the code. The contract needs to be coded and compiled as per image:

Now, we are ready to deploy the contract to our local Ganache chain by connecting to the Injected Web3 environment. The main account (owner) is the first one listed in my Ganache list. The additional 3 employee accounts are the three subsequest accounts in my Ganache

The thirst step is that after deploying your contract, you will be able to interact with the Deploy and Balance buttons:

You can see the balance decrease once you have sent a deposit through. Additionally, the transaction will be recorded in your MetaMask:
